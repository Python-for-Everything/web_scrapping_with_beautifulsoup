# Data Scraping with Python

## What is Data Scraping?
**Data Scraping** is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It allows us to collect and analyze web data efficiently using programming tools.

In this project, we use **Python** with libraries like:
- **Requests**: To fetch HTML content from a website.
- **BeautifulSoup**: To parse and extract data from HTML.
- **lxml**: To improve HTML parsing performance.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed and install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
